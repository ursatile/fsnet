summary: >
    In this section, we'll add Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to our application, and use it to connect to our SQL database and begin using relational data in our application code.

In the last section, we created an empty SQL Server database using Docker, and added a user that we can use to connect to that database from our application code.

### Code-First, Database-First or Model-First... what?

TODO: finish this.



Then:

- Create the Artist class
- Add the DbContext
- Generate the migration
- remove it
- fix the model
- generate the migration again
- apply it
- create a migration to populate the data
- apply that one
